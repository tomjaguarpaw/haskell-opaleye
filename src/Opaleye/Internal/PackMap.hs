-- TODO: We could attempt to generalise this to
--
-- data LensLike f a b s t = LensLike ((a -> f b) -> s -> f t)
--
-- i.e. a wrapped, argument-flipped Control.Lens.LensLike
--
-- This would allow us to do the Profunctor and ProductProfunctor

-- example, TableColumnMaker is like a Setter so we would restrict f
-- to the Distributive case.

-- | A 'PackMap' @a@ @b@ @s@ @t@ encodes how an @s@ contains an
-- updatable sequence of @a@ inside it.  Each @a@ in the sequence can
-- be updated to a @b@ (and the @s@ changes to a @t@ to reflect this
-- change of type).
--
-- 'PackMap' is just like a @Traversal@ from the lens package.
-- 'PackMap' has a different order of arguments to @Traversal@ because
-- it typically needs to be made a 'Profunctor' (and indeed
-- 'ProductProfunctor') in @s@ and @t@.  It is unclear at this point
-- whether we want the same @Traversal@ laws to hold or not.  Our use
-- cases may be much more general.
