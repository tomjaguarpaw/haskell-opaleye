{-|
An 'Aggregator' takes a collection of rows of type @a@, groups
them, and transforms each group into a single row of type @b@. This
corresponds to aggregators using @GROUP BY@ in SQL.

You should combine basic 'Aggregator's into 'Aggregator's on compound
types by using the operations in "Data.Profunctor.Product".

An 'Aggregator' corresponds closely to a 'Control.Foldl.Fold' from the
@foldl@ package.  Whereas an 'Aggregator' @a@ @b@ takes each group of
type @a@ to a single row of type @b@, a 'Control.Foldl.Fold' @a@ @b@
takes a list of @a@ and returns a single row of type @b@.

-- | Order the values within each aggregation in `Aggregator` using
-- the given ordering. This is only relevant for aggregations that
-- depend on the order they get their elements, like
-- `Opaleye.Aggregate.arrayAgg` and `Opaleye.Aggregate.stringAgg`.
--
-- You can either apply it to an aggregation of multiple columns, in
-- which case it will apply to all aggregation functions in there, or you
-- can apply it to a single column, and then compose the aggregations
-- afterwards. Examples:
--
-- > x :: Aggregator (Column a, Column b) (Column (PGArray a), Column (PGArray a))
-- > x = (,) <$> orderAggregate (asc snd) (lmap fst arrayAggGrouped)
-- >         <*> orderAggregate (desc snd) (lmap fst arrayAggGrouped)
--
-- This will generate:
--
-- @
-- SELECT array_agg(a ORDER BY b ASC), array_agg(a ORDER BY b DESC)
-- FROM (SELECT a, b FROM ...)
-- @
--
-- Or:
--
-- > x :: Aggregator (Column a, Column b) (Column (PGArray a), Column (PGArray b))
-- > x = orderAggregate (asc snd) $ p2 (arrayAggGrouped, arrayAggGrouped)
--
-- This will generate:
--
-- @
-- SELECT array_agg(a ORDER BY b ASC), array_agg(b ORDER BY b ASC)
-- FROM (SELECT a, b FROM ...)
