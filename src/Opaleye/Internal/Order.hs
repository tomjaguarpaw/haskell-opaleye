{-|
An `Order` @a@ represents a sort order and direction for the elements
of the type @a@. Multiple `Order`s can be composed with
`Data.Monoid.mappend` or @(\<\>)@ from "Data.Monoid".  If two rows are
equal according to the first `Order` in the @mappend@, the second is
used, and so on.

-- Like the (columns -> RowParser haskells) field of FromFields this
-- type is "too big".  We never actually look at the 'a' (in the
-- FromFields case the 'columns') except to check the "structure".
-- This is so we can support a SumProfunctor instance.

-- first in a result set. Entries in the input list that are /not/ present in
