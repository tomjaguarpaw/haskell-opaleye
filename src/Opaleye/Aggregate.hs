{-|
Given a 'Query' producing rows of type @a@ and an 'Aggregator' accepting rows of
type @a@, apply the aggregator to the results of the query.

If you simply want to count the number of rows in a query you might
find the 'countRows' function more convenient.

By design there is no aggregation function of type @Aggregator b b' ->
QueryArr a b -> QueryArr a b'@.  Such a function would allow violation
of SQL's scoping rules and lead to invalid queries.

Please note that when aggregating an empty query with no @GROUP BY@
clause, Opaleye's behaviour differs from Postgres's behaviour.
Postgres returns a single row whereas Opaleye returns zero rows.
Opaleye's behaviour is consistent with the meaning of aggregating
over groups of rows and Postgres's behaviour is inconsistent.  When a
query has zero rows it has zero groups, and thus zero rows in the
result of an aggregation.
