-- | Functions for working directly with 'Field_'s.
--
-- Please note that numeric 'Field_' types are instances of 'Num', so
-- you can use '*', '/', '+', '-' on them.  To create 'Field_'s, see
-- "Opaleye.ToFields" and "Opaleye.SqlTypes".
--
-- 'Field_' used to be called t'C.Column' and for technical reasons
-- there are still a few uses of the old name around.  If you see
-- @t'C.Column' SqlType@ then you can understand it as @'Field'
-- SqlType@, and if you see @t'C.Column' ( t'C.Nullable' SqlType )@ then
-- you can understand it as @'FieldNullable' SqlType@.
--
-- t'C.Column' will be removed in version 0.11.
--
-- (Due to Haddock formatting errors, this documentation previously
-- incorrectly stated that @Field_@ would be removed.  It won't be!)
