* Add `jsonAgg`, `jsonBuildObject` and `jsonBuildObjectField`.  Thanks
  to Nathan Jaremko.

## 0.7.1.0

* Added `Opaleye.Experimental.Enum` for an easy way to deal with
  Postgres `ENUM` types.

* Added `Opaleye.Manipulation.rReturningI` which has better type
  inference.

* Added `Opaleye.Operators.where_` for easier restriction in monadic
  style.

* Added `Opaleye.Operators.sqlLength` and
  `Opaleye.Operators.dateOfTimestamp`.

## 0.7.0.0

* Many renamings have taken place to help make Opaleye easier to
  understand.  The old versions have been deprecated.

* All previously deprecated functions have been removed.

Old | New
-----|-------
Query | Select
QueryArr | SelectArr
PG*Type*  | Sql*Type*
PG*Class* | Sql*Class*
Constant | ToFields
QueryRunner | FromFields
QueryRunnerColumn | FromField
QueryRunnerColumnDefault | DefaultFromField
TableProperties | TableFields
optional | optionalTableField
required | requiredTableField
readOnly | readOnlyTableField

## 0.6.7006.0

* Added `Opaleye.RunSelect.runSelectI` and
  `Opaleye.ToFields.toFieldsI` which have better inferability.

* Preliminary `FOR UPDATE` support in `Opaleye.Internal.Locking`.

* Added `fromFieldArray` for making `FromField`s for arrays.

## 0.6.7005.0

* Thanks to Shane (@duairc) and Ollie Charles (@ocharles) for writing
  most of the `lateral`- and `MaybeFields`-related code in this
  release.

* Add a `Monad` instance for `Select` (and `SelectArr i`).

* Add `Opaleye.Lateral`, to support LATERAL subqueries.

* Add `Opaleye.Join.optionalRestrict` and `Opaleye.Join.optional`, as
  more convenient and composable ways of doing left/right joins.

* Add `Opaleye.MaybeFields`

* Add `optionalTableField`, `readOnlyTableField`,
  `requiredTableField`, to replace `optional`, `readOnly` and
  `required` in a later version.

* Add `valuesSafe`, a version of `values`. `values` of an empty list
  generates incorrect queries when mixed with @OUTER@/@LEFT@/@RIGHT
  JOIN@s.  `valuesSafe` will replace it in version 0.7

* Add `Opaleye.Adaptors` as the forward-compatible place to import
  `Unpackspec` and `unpackspecField` from, as well as other adaptors.

* Unicode characters are escaped properly in `sqlString`/`toFields`

* Add `inSelect`, to replace `inQuery` in a future version.

* Add `unsafeCoerceField`, to replace `unsafeCoerceColumn` in a future
  version.

* Generalise label to type `label :: String -> S.SelectArr a b ->
S.SelectArr a b`

* [Fix invalid queries
  bug](https://github.com/tomjaguarpaw/haskell-opaleye/pull/468) in
  `union`, `unionAll`, `except` and `exceptAll` where one side was
  empty.

## 0.6.7004.2

* No user-visible changes

## 0.6.7004.1

* Fixed exponential slowdown in `removeEmpty`.

* Fixed `read` compatibility with time-1.9 in test suite.

## 0.6.7004.0

* Many changes to the documentation that use the new names.  See entry
  for version 0.6.7000.0.

* Added `fromPGSFromField` to replace `fieldQueryRunnerColumn`.

* Added `fromPGSFieldParser` to replace `fieldParserQueryRunnerColumn`.

* Added `defaultFromField` to replace `queryRunnerColumnDefault`.

* Added `tableField` to replace `tableColumn`.

* Added `unsafeFromField` to replace `queryRunnerColumn`.

* Added `toFieldsExplicit` to replace `constantExplicit`.

* Added `TableRecordField` to replace `TableField` in
  `Opaleye.TypeFamilies`.  The latter may be used to replace
  `TableColumn` in the future.

* Added array functions `arrayAppend`, `arrayRemove`, `arrayRemoveNulls`.

## 0.6.7003.1

* Bumped some depedencies so there is an install plan on GHC 8.6

## 0.6.7003.0

* Add `tableField` as a future replacement for `tableColumn`

* Export `Opaleye.Field` and `Opaleye.RunSelect` from `Opaleye`

* Use new nomenclature in tutorials

## 0.6.7002.0

This is a breaking release that doesn't follow the PVP but because
it's essentially a pre-release for version 0.7 I'm just going to
blacklist the broken versions on Hackage and forget about it.

* Swapped `N` and `NN` because they were the wrong way round.

## 0.6.7001.0

* Fix bug with infinity in range bounds

* Fix incompatibility with GHC 8.4

* Add range accessors, `upperBound` and `lowerBound`

* Add `distinctOn` and `distinctOnBy`

## 0.6.7000.0

This is a pre-release of version 0.7.0.0.  GHC >= 8.0 is required.  It
contains the following new important features

* A new API for manipulation, including `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
  support for `UPDATE`

* Initial support for product types written in "Higher kinded data"
  style (but deriving of related functionality using TH or Generics is
  not yet provided).

* Type inference for outer joins

* Many renamings.  In particular, `Column` will become `Field` in
  0.7.0.0.  You should be able to almost completely port your code to
  the 0.7.0.0 names whilst remaining compatible with 0.6.7000.0.
